    "question": "A financial services company is designing a global trading application on AWS. The application requires extremely low latency communication between instances in different AWS Regions (us-east-1 and eu-west-1) for its core trading engine. The application also has a web front-end that serves users globally. Which combination of services provides the best performance for both the trading engine and the web front-end?",

    "question": "A media company is migrating its video-on-demand (VOD) platform to AWS. The platform stores petabytes of video files. The company wants to optimize storage costs. The access pattern is that new videos are accessed frequently for the first 30 days, then access becomes infrequent. However, any video, regardless of age, must be available for streaming with low latency. Which S3 storage class transition policy is the MOST cost-effective?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-IA after 30 days, and then to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 90 days.",
      "B": "Transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Intelligent-Tiering after 30 days.",
      "C": "Keep all objects in S3 Standard and use Amazon CloudFront to cache content closer to users.",
      "D": "Transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-IA after 30 days, and then to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 90 days."

    "options": {
      "A": "Enable encryption on the RDS database using the default AWS-managed KMS key.",
      "B": "Enable encryption on the RDS database using a customer-managed KMS key (CMK) and enable automatic key rotation.",
      "C": "Encrypt the data at the application level before writing it to the RDS database.",
      "D": "Use Amazon RDS Proxy to enforce SSL/TLS connections to the database."

    "question": "A retail company runs its e-commerce platform on AWS. The platform uses an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in front of an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances. During flash sales, the platform experiences sudden, massive spikes in traffic. The company has noticed that the Auto Scaling group is too slow to react, causing performance degradation. How can a solutions architect design the architecture to handle these traffic spikes more effectively?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Configure a scheduled scaling policy to increase capacity just before a planned flash sale.",
      "B": "Use a target tracking scaling policy based on the CPU utilization of the EC2 instances.",
      "C": "Implement a step scaling policy with a warm-up period for newly launched instances.",
      "D": "Configure a predictive scaling policy based on historical traffic data from CloudWatch."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "Predictive scaling analyzes historical demand and launches capacity ahead of expected spikes, outperforming purely reactive policies during flash events."
  },
  {
    "question": "A company has a multi-account AWS environment managed with AWS Organizations. The security team wants to enforce a policy that denies any IAM user or role in any member account from disabling AWS CloudTrail. How can this be achieved centrally?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Create an IAM policy with a Deny statement for the cloudtrail:StopLogging action and attach it to all IAM users and roles.",
      "B": "Create a Service Control Policy (SCP) with a Deny statement for the cloudtrail:StopLogging action and attach it to the organization's root or relevant OUs.",
      "C": "Configure AWS Config rules to detect when CloudTrail is disabled and trigger an AWS Lambda function to re-enable it.",
      "D": "Use AWS Security Hub to automatically remediate any accounts where CloudTrail has been disabled."
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "An explicit Deny in an Organizations SCP blocks the action across member accounts—including root—preventing CloudTrail from being disabled."
